# 🚀 Quick Start Guide

## ✅ Everything is Fixed and Ready!

Your Greenspace Detection Web App is now fully set up and ready to use.

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run

```bash
# Make sure you're in the correct directory
cd /Users/salman/Documents/UN/greenspace-mei/greenspace-app

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

## 🌐 Access Your App

Open your browser and go to: **http://localhost:3000**

## 🎯 What's Fixed

- ✅ **Next.js Config**: Converted from TypeScript to JavaScript
- ✅ **Dependencies**: All npm packages installed correctly  
- ✅ **Python Environment**: Virtual environment created with all required packages
- ✅ **Security**: Updated Next.js to secure version
- ✅ **API Routes**: Updated to use virtual environment Python

## 🧪 Test Your App

1. **Select a City**: Choose from 50+ cities (try Toronto first)
2. **Configure Settings**: Adjust NDVI threshold (default 0.3 works well)
3. **Start Processing**: Click "Start Processing" and watch real-time progress
4. **View Results**: See vegetation highlighting and download files

## 📁 Important Directories

- `src/`: Next.js React components and API routes
- `python_scripts/`: Satellite processing scripts
- `venv/`: Python virtual environment (don't commit this)
- `public/outputs/`: Generated processing results

## 🐛 If You See Errors

**Wrong Directory Error**: Make sure you run `npm run dev` from inside the `greenspace-app` folder, not the parent directory.

**Python Errors**: The virtual environment is already set up. Just run `npm run dev`.
